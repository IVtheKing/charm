Things to do
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DONE: At context store and restore, interrupts should be disabled
2. DONE: In function OSTimer1ISR, after the S3C2440_ContextStore call, the
	function continues to run on the same threads context. This is not entirely correct
	We will have to restore it to system context before we return;

3. DONE: There may be many places where we need the mutual exclusion. So review the entire code

4. Implement the logic for measuring the CPU utilization

5. DONE: Think if the logic to consider the next thread from the OS_Reschedule function is
	correct or not. You might miss some tasks which happened to be placed before the
	current task?

6. DONE: Implement the Budget timer functionality fully

7. DONE: Consider the case when deadline < period

8. Implement Sleep

9. Implement Semaphore for the next aperiodic tasks

10. Debug the problem with D & E on the target

11. For many of the OS private functions, I don't have a common header file. Every source file redeclares functions as extern.

12. Implement sleep / wake functionality

13. Have code to copy the NAND content into memory and run if needed

14. Initialize memory controller

Limitations:
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. No nested interrupt support
